# Supplements


In the dynamic landscape of health and wellness, supplements have emerged as versatile aids designed to complement nutrition, prescription drugs, and behavior protocols. Supplements like vitamin D3 for people not getting enough sunlight or omega-3 fatty acids for people not getting enough fish in their diet have become quite popular. While their popularity has skyrocketed and they are really helpful in many cases, it's crucial to understand that supplements are not a panacea; there's no substitute for sunlight or a nourishing diet and lifestyle.

## Dietary supplements

The essence of dietary supplements lies in bridging nutritional gaps rather than replacing a wholesome diet. Despite their easy availability, it is still a drug and if taken in excess or without proper knowledge, it can be do more harm than good. At the end of the day, there is no replacement for a healthy diet. However, for specific lifestyles, such as a vegan diet, where obtaining all nutrients solely from food is challenging, supplements become a necessity.

Common supplements include multivitamins, minerals, herbs, botanical compounds, probiotics, amino acids, etc. While our body can synthesize some of these compounds, others need to be obtained from the diet. For example, our body can synthesize vitamin D from sunlight and vitamin B3 from the amino acid tryptophan. However, all the other vitamins need to be sourced from the diet. Vegetarians and vegans can only get protein from plant sources, such as legumes, nuts, and seeds. However, these sources are not complete proteins, meaning they do not contain all the essential amino acids. In such cases, supplements can be used to fill in the gaps.

### Vitamins

Vitamin D deficiency affects approximately 42% of the US population, rising to 82% among African Americans.[^1] Our body gets most of the vitamin D from sunlight while egg yolks, fatty fish, and fortified foods are other good sources. However, the amount of vitamin D obtained from food is not enough to meet the daily requirement. Hence, vitamin D supplements are highly recommended. Vitamin D is a fat-soluble vitamin, meaning it is stored in the body (liver and fat tissue) for a long time. Thus, moderation is key and important not to exceed the recommended daily intake.

Another common deficiency is vitamin B12, prevalent in animal products, such as meat, fish, eggs, and dairy. Vegans and vegetarians face a higher risk, but B12 supplements are a safe remedy. Vitamin B12 is a water-soluble vitamin, meaning any excess is excreted through urine. However, moderation is still important.

### Minerals

Iron is abundant in food like nuts and leafy greens. Although a food first approach is recommended, people with iron deficiency or anemia may opt for iron supplements. Several studies have shown such supplements to improve haemoglobin concentration in women with iron deficiency and even help alleviate menstrual pain and heavy bleeding.[^2] However, it is important to note that too much iron can lead to iron poisoning.

Despite magnesium being the fourth most abundant mineral in the body, it is estimated that around 50% of the US population is deficient. Also, magnesium deficiency often goes undiagnosed because the lab tests only measure serum magnesium levels (magnesium in blood) but not intracellular magnesium. Deficiency of magnesium has been linked to numerous types of cardiovascular diseases.[^3] Seeds, legumes, leafy greens, avocados, nuts, tofu, bananas and even dark chocolate are good sources of magnesium. However, due to the aforementioned reasons and depleting magnesium levels in soil, magnesium supplements can be helpful.

Zinc is another mineral that is important for wound healing, the immune system and even vision. Since it is predominantly found in animal products, such as meat, fish, and eggs, vegans and vegetarians are at a higher risk of zinc deficiency. Supplements can be helpful in such cases. However, long term and high doses of zinc supplements can lead to copper deficiency which can lead to neurological issues.[^4]

### Digestive enzymes

Digestive enzymes, the body's natural aids in breaking down food, are vital for nutrient absorption. Deficiencies in these enzymes can lead to digestive issues, prompting the use of supplements. However, the effectiveness of these supplements is still under debate, and caution is advised.

Digestive enzymes are proteins produced by our gastrointestinal system especially pancreas, to help break down food into smaller molecules thus helping in nutrient absorption. The different types of digestive enzymes are: amylase (breaks down carbohydrates), protease (breaks down proteins), lipase (breaks down fats), lactase (breaks down lactose), and cellulase (breaks down cellulose).  Digestive enzyments can be found in fruits and vegetables, for example, papaya and pineapple. Some people may have a deficiency in digestive enzymes, which can lead to issues, such as bloating, gas, and diarrhea. For example, lactose intolerance is caused by the deficiency of lactase enzyme while EPI (exocrine pancreatic insufficiency) can happen when the pancreas is damaged and cannot produce enough digestive enzymes. There are several digestive enzyme supplements available in the market, some of which may ease the symptoms of digestive issues. However, these supplements are not regulated by the FDA and their efficacy is still debatable.

### Adaptogens

Adaptogens do not have a standard definition but they are generally considered to be natural substances that act against various stressors. Ashwagandha, for example, has shown promise in reducing stress and anxiety.[^5] However, more research is needed to understand the efficacy of adaptogens.

### Prebiotics and probiotics

Gut microbiome refers to the trillions of microorganisms living in our gastrointestinal tract. Probiotics are the so-called good bacteria that help with digestion and absorption of nutrients. Prebiotics are non-digestible fibers, found in legumes, bananas, garlic, onions, etc, that are food for those good bacteria. Probiotics are found in fermented foods, such as yogurt, kimchi, and sauerkraut. Studies have shown transient improvement in gut microbiome with probiotics. Probiotic supplements are supposed to carry live bacteria to the large instestine, however most of them do not survive the harsh environment of the stomach. Choice of such supplements depends on the right strain, product formula and the quality of the product. Therefore, it is important to do your research before buying. Again, as with everything, food first approach is _always_ recommended. In fact, research indicates that eating fiber-rich foods help promote a healthy gut microbiome than taking probiotic supplements as our gut microbiome is unique to us. However, probiotic supplements can be helpful in some cases. For example, people with IBS (irritable bowel syndrome) may benefit from such supplements.

### Omega-3 fatty acids

Omega-3 fatty acids are essential fatty acids, meaning our body cannot produce them and we need to get them from the diet. They have many proven health benefits for the body and brain. Yet, a significant percentage of the population over 68% of the adult and 95% of the children in the US do not meet the daily requirement of omega-3 fatty acids.[^6] There are 3 types of omega-3 fatty acids: ALA (alpha-linolenic acid), EPA (eicosapentaenoic acid), and DHA (docosahexaenoic acid). ALA is found in plant sources, such as flaxseeds, chia seeds, and walnuts. EPA and DHA are found in animal sources, such as fatty fish and fish oil. Omega-3 fatty acids help reduce inflammation[^7], improve brain function (especially in kids), reduce dry eyes and dermatitis, decrease liver fat[^8] and increase calcium absorption. Omega-3 can also help with depression[^9], anxiety[^10] and even help fight asthma symptoms.[^11]

### Protein

Protein, along with carbohydrates and fats, is one of the three macronutrients. Protein, made up of amino acids, which are the building blocks of our body, is important for muscle growth and repair, bone health, and even weight loss. Most studies suggest that an adult requires 1.6–2.2 grams per kg (0.7–1 gram per pound) of body weight per day.[^12] If consuming enough protein from the diet is difficult, supplements can be helpful. The choice of protein supplement is highly dependent on the individual's dietary restrictions and goals. For example, whey protein is a good choice for people who are looking to build muscle mass. However, it is not a good choice for people who are lactose intolerant or vegan. Whey protein, in some cases, also exacerbates acne in individuals.[^13] In such cases, plant-based protein supplements, such as pea protein, soy protein, or even potato protein, can be a good choice.

Plant based protein contain fewer branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) than animal based protein. BCAAs are important for muscle growth and repair. Additionally, among plant based protein, only soy protein can be considered a complete protein, meaning it contains all the essential amino acids. However, soy proteins have several issues, for example, they contain phytoestrogens, which can mimic estrogen in the body. Pea protein is a great alternative. Brands also sell protein blends which can be a good choice.

# Notes

- Supplements are not a replacement for a healthy diet and lifestyle.
- More often than not it is advantageous to take supplements with food.
- For dietary supplements, opt for formulations containing multiple vitamins and minerals.
- Important to play the long game and not expect results overnight. Start with a small dose and increase gradually.

# Conclusion

In the labyrinth of supplements, where each pill promises a pathway to optimal health, the key lies in balance, mindfulness and moderation. While supplements can be helpful and even vital in some cases, they cannot replace a healthy diet and lifestyle. The journey towards well-being is a nuanced journey, and supplements, when chosen wisely and consumed with care, can be a gateway to a healthier lifestyle. Remember, it's not a sprint but a marathon; start small, embrace patience, and remember to focus on the big picture - a healthy body and mind.
